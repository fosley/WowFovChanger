// Entries need to be in the format:
// Aspect ratio, Default fov bytes, xpack shortname, fov ratio, friendly name, fov offset, filesize, file version.
// Each entry is separated by a comma.
// Aspect ratio is the ratio used to get the fov ratio.
// -- If you calculated fov ratio on a 16:9 monitor, you'd put 1.777778.
// Default fov bytes are in little endian format (the same order they're stored in the binary).
// -- They can be represented as decimal values or hex values. E.g., 15 is 0xF.
// -- Bytes are separated by a semi-colon.
// Xpack shortname needs to match the hard-coded enums exactly.
// -- Other, Vanilla, Tbc, Wrath, Cata, Mists, Warlords, Legion, Bfa, Slands.
// Fov ratio is degrees divided by WoW angular units.
// -- If 1.57 gives you 80Â°, then fov ratio is 80 / 1.57 = 50.9.
// Friendly name is what shows up in the list in the program. It's just for convenience.
// -- It can't have commas or you'll break the load function.
// Fov offset is the address in the executable where the fov is stored.
// -- It can be represented as decimal or hex. E.g., 6190472 is 0x5E7588.
// Filesize is the size in bytes as measured by the program.
// File version is a string with major:minor:build.private as discovered by the program.
